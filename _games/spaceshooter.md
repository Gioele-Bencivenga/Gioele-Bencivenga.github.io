Retro arcade space shooter prototype I made using Haxe and HaxeFlixel with the Nape physics engine.

Development has stalled for now, this was my first Flixel project so the code is messy. I learned a lot from making the game though.

## Technologies

| Technology | Usage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) + [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) | Language and Framework in which I programmed the game |
| [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | IDE used for writing the code |
| [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) | PixelArt drawing tool used for minor edits on the image assets |
| [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) | Audio software used for minor edits on the audio assets |

The project is Open Source, the repository [can be found here](https://github.com/Gioele-Bencivenga/FlixelGame).
