Retro arcade space shooter prototype I made using Haxe and HaxeFlixel with the Nape physics engine.

Development has stalled for now, this was my first Flixel project so the code is messy. I learnt a lot from making the game though.

{% include gallery caption="Some screenshots from the game" %}

The project is Open Source, the repository [can be found here](https://github.com/Gioele-Bencivenga/FlixelGame).
