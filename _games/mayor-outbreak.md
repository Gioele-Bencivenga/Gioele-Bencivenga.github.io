Retro looking outbreak simulation prototype I made using [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) and [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) for the [Newgrounds HaxeFlixel Game Jam](https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1450269).

I started by following [this tutorial](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/tutorial/) on the Flixel website, then branched off and added some stuff of my own.

Development has stalled for now, this was my first Flixel project so the code is messy and I need to find the will to restructure some classes before adding more stuff. I learned a lot from making the game though.
