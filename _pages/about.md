I'm an Italian guy with interest in programming and technology in general.

I started out while in college by learning how to develop WPF programs in C# and XAML, then I got interested in making games and experimented with Unity for a while on my own.

At University I was taught Java and some Processing, then in the second year I was taught some mobile app development in Android Studio.
I didn't like Java too much and Android Studio had me interested in mobile applications so I experimented for a bit with Xamarin Forms which allowed me to use C#.

I then discovered Haxe and fell in love with the language. At the moment I'm learning Haxe and HaxeFlixel and using them to develop some small game prototypes.
